# img2txt_v1
This is not OCR program, nor AI-based program. But this code cut the image into fraction, and find the letter that best represents it.

## method
There can be more method as I continuously update this program. Today, this program supports Euclidean Distance, Cosine Similarity, Manhattan Distance and Pearson Correlation.

## convolution layer
I updated convolution layer : blur, edge detection, vertical/horizontal edge detection. You can apply 2(and more) layers if you give input as list.

## Future Features
I can update the program for every UI as there is some inconvenience.
Maybe I will try to make this distribute version; because this is first project for me

## examples
with Euclidean Distance :

with Pearson Correlation :

(yes, Correlation method looks absurd, but it will be better with edge detection)
