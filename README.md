This is not OCR program, nor AI-based program. But this code cut the image into fraction, and find the letter that best represents it.

## method
There can be more method as I continuously update this program. Today, this program supports Euclidean Distance, Cosine Similarity, and Pearson Correlation.

## Future Features
Soon, I will update the Convolution method : for edge detection etc. 
I can update the program for every UI as there is some inconvenience.

## examples
with Euclidean Distance :

with Pearson Correlation :

(yes, Correlation method looks absurd, but it will be better with edge detection)
